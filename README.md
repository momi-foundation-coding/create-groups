    // group the items[] by the number of people
}
```

const upload = (upload) => {
    // check the type of file, for now allow - Array, JSON, CSV and xls
    // convert JSON, then Array -> or direcly to array.
    // Call the grouping function to perform grouping.

5. Other ideas 
    a. Allow multiple selection using other characters e.g gender balance groups
    b. Think of other metrics

# Example 


Take for instance, `[student1, student2, student3, student4, student5, student6]` and group them into groups of `2 students`, example of result might be:
```
Group 1 - [student1, student3]
Group 2 - [student2, student6]
Group 3 - [student4, student5]
```
